Hi I am Chuyi Hou. I am a forth-year Engineering Science (Robotics) student whose thesis is being supervised by Prof. Margaret P. Chapman at Decision Analysis for Trustworthy Autonomy (DATA Lab), University of Toronto.

My **research interest** lies in:

Risk-analysis and stochastic optimal control. Algorithms that enable control systems to make smarterdecisions efficiently where safety cost is maximized. Machine Learning for Robotics and Control. Ma-chine learning models that enable robots to operate at higher accuracy. Human Computer Interaction. Algorithms/Tools/Models that enable a seamless interaction between human and computers.

Here is my [full CV](assests/pdf/CV.pdf){:target="\_blank"}.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com){:target="\_blank"}. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/){:target="\_blank"} and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/){:target="\_blank"}, like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
