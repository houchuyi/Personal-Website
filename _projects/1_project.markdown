This was a project from a course in the Engineering Science program at the University of Toronto. 
AER201: Engineering Design (now is ESC204: Praxis III) at University of Toronto.

This project was devided into three components: electromechanical, circuit&sensor, microcontroller. Three students formed a team and each is responsible for one component. The design concept was developed by everyone in the team.

I was the circuit&sensor memember in my team, hence I am responsible for all the circuit components of the robot. In later stages, I was responsible for the integration of the robot.
